Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Question:what is ruby gloom's guide for?
assistant
","<think>
To determine what Ruby Gloom's guide is for, I'll analyze the image:

1. The image shows a table with various items, including books and t-shirts.
2. There's a book titled ""Ruby Gloom"" on the table.
3. The book cover features a character with a red hat and a red dress.
4. The character is holding a book with a red cover.
5. The character is smiling and appears to be happy.

Given these observations, it's likely that ""Ruby Gloom"" is a series of books, possibly for children or young adults, given the cheerful and colorful nature of the character and the book cover.

Therefore, the answer is: Ruby Gloom's guide is likely for children or young adults, as indicated by the cheerful and colorful character on the book cover.

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Question:who wrote this?
assistant
","<think>
The image shows the spine of a book with the title ""Lady Wey and Madam How."" The text on the spine is in gold lettering on a red background. The title suggests that the book is likely a historical or literary work, possibly from the 19th century, given the style of the text and the design. However, without more context, it's not possible to determine the author's name from the image alone.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Question:what goes crunch in this recipe?
assistant
","<think>
The image shows a recipe book open to a page with a photograph of a dish. The dish appears to be a dessert, possibly brownies or a similar baked good, as indicated by the presence of a knife and a plate with a piece of the dessert. The text on the page mentions ""COOKING LIFE WHEN COFFEE GOES CRUNCH,"" which suggests that the crunchy part of the recipe is likely the coffee used in the dessert. Therefore, the crunchy part of the recipe is the coffee.

The text in the image is partially obscured, but it appears to be a book title or a phrase. The visible part of the text includes ""Jane and Jeremy Stroe"" and ""Twice.""

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Question:what other books has orson scott card write?

","<think>
To answer this question, I need to identify other books written by Orson Scott Card. The image shows the back cover of ""The Wishing Saga,"" which is a book by Orson Scott Card. However, it does not provide information about other books he has written. To find this information, I would need to search for Orson Scott Card's other works or consult a reliable source of his bibliography.

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

The book is about the Woodlawn Cemetery, which is a memorial for firefighters who were killed during the 1910 fires in the United States. It recognizes the men who were killed when fires overtook much of the St. Joe River drainage. The memorial is dedicated to the firefighters who were moved to this site from temporary graves near where they fell in areas such as Big Creek and Setzer Creek.",0.0,/data1/jjw/dataset/train-00000-of-00020.parquet,108,0

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. 


# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{""name"": ""rotate-rotate"", ""description"": ""Rotate the image by a specified angle.\n\n    Args:\n        degree (int): The angle of rotation (positive for clockwise, negative for counter-clockwise).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The Base64 encoded string of the rotated image.\n    "", ""parameters"": {""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": {""degree"": {""title"": ""Degree"", ""type"": ""integer""}}, ""required"": [""degree""]}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

"system
You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. 


# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
<tools>
{""name"": ""rotate-rotate"", ""description"": ""Rotate the image by a specified angle.\n\n    Args:\n        degree (int): The angle of rotation (positive for clockwise, negative for counter-clockwise).\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The Base64 encoded string of the rotated image.\n    "", ""parameters"": {""type"": ""object"", ""properties"": {""degree"": {""title"": ""Degree"", ""type"": ""integer""}}, ""required"": [""degree""]}}
</tools>

For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
<tool_call>
{""name"": <function-name>, ""arguments"": <args-json-object>}
</tool_call>

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

You are a helpful assistant. Given a question and an image, answer the question based strictly on visual content. Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. 


# Tools

You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.

Any time you receive new information, you should reason step by step inside the <think> and </think> XML tag. Afterwards, you can either choose to call tool functions or directly provide the answer. If the input is an inverted/rotated image, automatically detect its orientation and use the tool to correct it to a standard upright position. Only after correction can you provide the final answer wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag. All response must be in English and final answer should be brief and concise wrapped with <answer></answer> XML tag.
